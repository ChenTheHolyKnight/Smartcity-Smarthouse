# SmartCity - Elder Support
An autonomous system which keeps track of the well being and day to day activity of an elderly person. The purpose of this project is to develop the core of the system, alongside several tools that will be able to achieve this goal.

# Contributions
The project is developed using the `Java` programming language. To run the code you will need JDK 8 and the JavaFX library. For a better understanding of the project structure, please read the [System Overview](https://github.com/TechnionYP5777/SmartCity-Elderly-Support/wiki/System-Overview) wiki page, which presents the different parts of the project.

## Windows
To install the required run time environment and libraries, simply go to the Oracle official download pages, and download any JDK 8 release installation.

## Linux
If installing using the `apt-get` program, run the following commands:

`sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk`

`sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre`

And the following command to install the JavaFX library:

`sudo apt-get install openjfx`

These three commands will install the java development kit, java runtime environment and the JavaFX library. Another option would be to go to the official Oracle download page, download the java binaries and do the installation manually.
